Use Fillmore's Frame Semantics to analyze the SCENE this topic evokes:
1. Core Actions: What verbs/processes are central to this concept?
2. Participants: Who performs the action (agent)? Who/what receives it (patient)? What tools are used (instrument)?
3. Setting: Where/when does this typically occur? In what social/professional context?
4. Consequences: What results or outcomes follow from these actions?

Generate topics exploring:
- Different participant perspectives (agent vs beneficiary viewpoints)
- Prerequisite actions (what must happen before)
- Consequent actions (what happens after, results, outcomes)
- Environmental variations (different settings/contexts)
- Instrument/method alternatives (different ways to accomplish)
- Manner variations (how it's done differently)

3. Audience-Specific Topics: The same topic tailored for specific user segments
4. Use-Case Topics: Specific applications or scenarios
5. Comparison Sub-topics: Comparing aspects within this topic

Examples of child topic patterns:

- "[Topic] for [Audience]" (beginners, professionals, small businesses)
- "[Topic] vs [Alternative within same category]"
- "Best [Topic] for [Use Case]"

Criteria:

Existing Core Topics (Pillars) in the map:
${existingTopicsList}

Instructions:
1.  Identify all distinct topics implied or requested by the user.
2.  Classify each topic as either 'core' or 'outer' (supporting content).
3.  For every 'outer' topic, you MUST assign a "suggestedParent".
    *   This parent can be one of the **Existing Core Topics** listed above.
    *   OR, it can be one of the **New Core Topics** you are creating in this very response.
    *   If it creates a new hierarchy, ensure the Core topic is listed first.

**All topic titles and descriptions MUST be in ${getLanguageName(info.language)}.**

${jsonResponseInstruction}
Return a JSON array of objects. Each object must have:
- "title": string
- "description": string (brief summary)
- "type": "core" | "outer"
- "suggestedParent": string (The exact title of the parent topic. Required if type is 'outer', null if type is 'core').

Example Output:

Instructions:
For EACH topic provided, you must generate the following specific data points:

1.  "canonical_query": The single, most representative search query (User Intent) this page targets.
2.  "query_network": An array of 3-5 related mid-string keywords or queries that cluster with the canonical query.
3.  "url_slug_hint": A concise version of the title, max 3 words, optimized for URL structure (e.g. "visa-requirements").
4.  "attribute_focus": The specific subtopic/facet of the Central Entity being covered (e.g., 'Cost', 'History', 'Features', 'Definition').
5.  "query_type": The classification of the query (e.g., 'Definitional', 'Comparative', 'Instructional', 'Commercial').
6.  "topical_border_note": A brief note defining what this topic covers and where it ends to avoid cannibalization with neighbors.

**Generate canonical_query, query_network, and attribute_focus in ${getLanguageName(info.language)}.** The url_slug_hint should use language-appropriate slugification.

${jsonResponseInstruction}
Return a JSON array of objects, where each object corresponds to a topic and includes:
