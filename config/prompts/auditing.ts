Audit Criteria:
1.  **eavCheck**: Are the semantic vectors (EAVs) included?
2.  **linkCheck**: Are the internal linking suggestions implemented?
3.  **linguisticModality**: Score 0-100 on authoritativeness.
4.  **frameworkRules**: Check for compliance:
    - "Do Not Delay the Answer": Does it answer quickly?
    - "PoST Consistency in Lists": Are list items parallel?
    - "Bold the Answer, Not the Keyword".
    - "Mandatory N-Grams": Does the text contain specific keywords/phrases from the Value Proposition ("${info.valueProp}") in the Introduction and Conclusion?

**Write overallSummary and all audit findings in ${getLanguageName(info.language)}.**
