### **STRICT EXECUTION RULES**

#### **I. FOUNDATIONAL STRATEGY & ENTITY ALIGNMENT**
1.  **Central Entity Focus (Rule I.A):** Every heading and sub-heading must modify the Central Entity ("${pillars.centralEntity}"). Reject broad generalizations.
2.  **Source Context Alignment (Rule I.B):** Filter attributes based on the Source Context ("${pillars.sourceContext}"). Only include attributes relevant to the monetization intent (e.g., if context is "Enterprise", exclude "Free" or "Cheap").
3.  **Attribute Prioritization (Rule I.D):** Structure the 'outline' to prioritize **Unique Attributes** (definitive features/IDs) FIRST, followed by **Root Attributes** (Definitions/Nature), then **Rare Attributes** (Specific details).
4.  **EAV-Section Mapping (Rule I.E):** For each section in 'structured_outline', include a 'mapped_eavs' field listing which Semantic Triples (by index from the list above) that section is responsible for covering. Every UNIQUE and ROOT triple MUST appear in at least one section's mapped_eavs. Example: { "heading": "Robot Materials", "mapped_eavs": [2, 5, 8] }

#### **II. STRUCTURE & FLOW**
1.  **Contextual Vector (Rule II.B):** Ensure a strictly ordered heading hierarchy (H1 -> H2 -> H3) that creates a logical dependency chain.
2.  **The Contextual Bridge (Rule II.D):** You MUST define a specific 'contextualBridge' object. This is a dedicated section (transition paragraph) that bridges the **Macro Context** (The Site's Core Entity) to the **Micro Context** (This Article's Topic).
3.  **Subordinate Text (Rule II.F):** For every H2/H3 in the 'structured_outline', provide a 'subordinate_text_hint'. This MUST dictate the syntax of the *very first sentence* (e.g., "Define [Topic] as [Category] that [Function]...").
4.  **Introductory Summary (Rule II.E):** Mandate an abstractive summary at the start.
5.  **Discourse Anchor Sequence (Rule II.G):** For each section transition, define in 'discourse_anchor_sequence':
    - Which section leads to which (from_section -> to_section)
    - The bridging concept that connects them
    - Key terms that should appear in the transition sentence
    - Type of transition (elaboration, contrast, cause_effect, sequence, example, summary)

#### **III. LINGUISTIC DIRECTIVES**
1.  **Explicit Naming (Rule III.D):** Instruct the writer to use **Explicit Naming**. Strictly FORBID ambiguous pronouns ("it", "they", "this") when referring to the Central Entity.
2.  **No Opinion (Rule III.G):** Strictly FORBID subjective phrases ("I think", "In my opinion", "Ideally"). Require declarative facts.
3.  **Discourse Integration (Rule III.H):** Generate a list of 'discourse_anchors'. These are specific mutual words/phrases to use at the end of Paragraph A and the start of Paragraph B to ensure flow.
4.  **Featured Snippet Target (Rule III.C):** Identify the SINGLE most important question this article answers. Define it as the 'featured_snippet_target'. The answer target length must be < 40 words.

#### **IV. VISUAL SEMANTICS (Pixels, Letters, and Bytes Framework)**
1.  **Data over Photos (Rule IV.A):** Do not request generic stock photos. Populate 'visual_semantics' with specific descriptions of **Infographics**, **Charts**, or **Data Tables** that represent the EAVs.
2.  **Centerpiece Alignment (Rule IV.B):** Each image MUST reinforce the page's centerpiece annotation. Include at least one entity name in the description.
3.  **Alt Text Requirements (Rule IV.C):**
    - Alt text must contain at least one entity name from the topic
    - Use vocabulary that EXTENDS the page content (synonyms, related terms NOT in headings)
    - Keep under 125 characters, natural language flow
    - Describe both visual content AND contextual purpose
4.  **File Naming Convention (Rule IV.D):** Specify filenames following pattern: [primary-entity]-[descriptor]-[context].jpg
5.  **Image Placement (Rule IV.E):** NEVER suggest placing an image between a heading and its first paragraph. Images go AFTER the definitional text.
6.  **Hero Image (Rule IV.F):** For transactional/monetization topics, specify a hero image that demonstrates the service/product with strong entity relevance.
7.  **Expected Image Types (Rule IV.G):** Based on search intent, suggest appropriate image types:
    - Informational: Diagrams, infographics, process charts, data visualizations
    - Transactional: Product photos, before/after, trust badges, team photos
    - Commercial: Comparison tables, feature matrices, pricing visuals
8.  **Visual Placement Anchoring (Rule IV.H):** For each image in visual_semantics, specify in 'visual_placement_map':
    - Which section heading it belongs under
    - Which entity mention it anchors to
    - Which EAV triple it illustrates (if applicable)
    - Rationale for placement (why here, not elsewhere)

#### **V. INTERLINKING**
1.  **Post-Definition Linking (Rule V.C):** In the 'contextualBridge' instructions, specify that links must be placed *after* the entity has been defined, never in the first sentence of a paragraph.
2.  **Generate 2-4 Internal Links (Rule V.A):** You MUST populate the 'contextualBridge.links' array with 2-4 internal link suggestions. For each link:
    - **targetTopic**: Use the EXACT topic title from "Available Topics for Linking" - copy it exactly, no modifications or explanations
    - **anchorText**: Write a SHORT natural anchor phrase (2-5 words ONLY) that can be used as clickable hyperlink text. Example: "semantic content strategy" or "topical map structure"
    - **annotation_text_hint**: Provide context on where this link should be placed
    - **reasoning**: Explain why this link adds value for the reader's journey
3.  **Semantic Relevance (Rule V.B):** Prioritize links to topics that share semantic overlap with this article. Sibling topics and parent topics are ideal candidates.
4.  **CRITICAL**: targetTopic MUST be a verbatim copy of a topic title from the available list. anchorText MUST be 2-5 words only.

#### **VI. FORMAT CODE ASSIGNMENT**
1.  **[FS] Featured Snippet**: Assign to the primary definition/answer section. 40-50 words max.
2.  **[PAA] People Also Ask**: Assign to FAQ-style questions.
3.  **[LISTING]**: Assign when listing features, steps, benefits, etc.
4.  **[DEFINITIVE]**: Assign to comprehensive explanations.
5.  **[TABLE]**: Assign to comparative data sections.
6.  **[PROSE]**: Default for standard prose sections.

#### **VII. ATTRIBUTE CATEGORY CLASSIFICATION**
For each section in 'structured_outline', classify using 'attribute_category':
- **ROOT**: Core defining attributes (definitions, what is, overview)
- **UNIQUE**: Differentiating features (vs competitors, unique aspects)
- **RARE**: Specific/technical details (specifications, advanced usage)
- **COMMON**: General/shared attributes (general info, context)

### **OUTPUT JSON STRUCTURE**

**CRITICAL: The 'structured_outline' field is MANDATORY and MUST be included with at least 5-8 sections. Do NOT skip this field.**

      }
    ]
  },
  "predicted_user_journey": "string"
}

1. **structured_outline** MUST contain 5-8 detailed section objects. This is the most critical field.

3. **serpAnalysis.avgHeadings** MUST be a realistic heading count estimate (typically 6-12).
4. **contextualBridge.links** MUST contain 2-4 internal link suggestions to related topics from the "Available Topics for Linking" list.
