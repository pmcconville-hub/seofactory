- **COMMON**: General/shared attributes common across the industry. Target ~15% of triples.

**LEXICAL ENRICHMENT (for semantic richness):**
For each triple, provide:
- synonyms: 2-3 alternative terms for the object value

**IMPORTANT:** All topic titles, descriptions, and canonical queries MUST be in ${getRegionalLanguageVariant(info.language, info.region)}. This is critical for SEO targeting.

**CRITICAL OBJECTIVE:** Target 80–150 total topics (8–15 Core Topics × ${hubSpokeRatio} Spokes each). Prioritize quality and semantic distinctness over volume. Cover every meaningful facet without creating redundant or thin topics.

Strategic Inputs:
- SEO Pillars: ${JSON.stringify(pillars, null, 2)}

**SEMANTIC HIERARCHY RULES (CRITICAL):**
A **CORE TOPIC** represents a DISTINCT ATTRIBUTE FACET of the Central Entity. It must be a fundamentally different service, product category, problem type, or major functional area.
An **OUTER TOPIC (Spoke)** is a VARIATION, MODIFIER, or SPECIFIC INSTANCE of a Core Topic.

**FORBIDDEN AS CORE TOPICS (These MUST be SPOKES instead):**
- Location variants (e.g., "[Service] in Amsterdam" → SPOKE, not core)
- Price/cost modifiers (e.g., "Cheap [Service]" → SPOKE)
- Urgency variants (e.g., "Emergency [Service]" → SPOKE)
- Size/scope variants (e.g., "Small Business [Service]" → SPOKE)
- Brand comparisons (e.g., "[Service] vs [Competitor]" → SPOKE)

**VALID CORE TOPIC EXAMPLES:**
- Different service categories (Installation vs Repair vs Maintenance)
- Different product types (Residential vs Commercial systems)
- Different problem domains (Detection vs Prevention vs Response)
- Different functional areas (Assessment vs Implementation vs Support)

**SEMANTIC FRAME COVERAGE (CRITICAL):**
Your topical map MUST cover these 10 semantic frames across the combined monetization + informational sections. Each frame represents a fundamental information need. Missing frames = incomplete topical authority.

1. Definition — "What is [CE]?" (entity identity, category, distinguishing features)
2. Components — "What are the parts of [CE]?" (structure, sub-types, hierarchy)
3. Process — "How does [CE] work?" (steps, procedures, usage)
4. Comparison — "How does [CE] differ from alternatives?" (vs competitors, trade-offs)
5. Benefits — "What are the advantages of [CE]?" (outcomes, ROI, value)
6. Risks — "What are the risks of [CE]?" (problems, concerns, mitigation)
7. Cost — "How much does [CE] cost?" (pricing, budgets, payment)
8. Evaluation — "How to choose/evaluate [CE]?" (criteria, standards, benchmarks)
9. Troubleshooting — "What problems occur with [CE]?" (common issues, solutions)
10. Future — "What trends affect [CE]?" (evolution, emerging developments)

Some frames map naturally to monetization topics (Comparison, Cost, Evaluation), others to informational topics (Definition, Process, Risks, Troubleshooting, Future). Ensure BOTH sections collectively cover all 10 frames.

**ANTI-CANNIBALIZATION RULE:**
Before finalizing your topic list, check for pairs of topics whose canonical queries share >70% word overlap. If found, MERGE them into one topic or differentiate their angles. Two topics targeting the same intent waste crawl budget and dilute authority.

**DEPTH BALANCE RULE:**
All core topic clusters should have roughly equal depth. No cluster should have more than 2x the spokes of the smallest cluster. If one area naturally has more subtopics, split it into two distinct core topics rather than overloading one hub.

**Expansion Strategy (Think in ${getLanguageName(info.language)}):**
1.  **Monetization Section (Core Section / Money Pages):**
    *   **MANDATORY: Generate a MINIMUM of 6 SEMANTICALLY DISTINCT Core Topics.**
    *   Each Core Topic MUST target a different attribute/facet of "${pillars.centralEntity}"
    *   **HARD CONSTRAINT (1:${hubSpokeRatio} HUB-SPOKE RATIO):** For EVERY Core Topic, generate exactly **${hubSpokeRatio} unique Spokes**.
    *   *Spoke Ideas:* Location variants, price tiers, urgency levels, specific use cases, comparisons, checklists.
    *   *Example Structure:* "[Service Type]" (Core) → "Emergency [Service Type]", "[Service Type] Costs", "[Service Type] in [Location]", etc. (Spokes)

2.  **Informational Section (Author Section / Trust Pages):**
    *   Topics related to "${pillars.centralEntity} + Knowledge/Background/Trust".
    *   Generate 3-5 distinct clusters covering: Laws/Regulations, General Costs, Procedures, Industry Background.
    *   Each cluster must have 3-5 supporting spokes.

**Granular Node Identity (REQUIRED for each topic):**
For every topic (Core AND Spoke), provide:
- "canonical_query": The single, most representative search query (User Intent).
- "query_network": An array of 3-5 related mid-string keywords.
- "url_slug_hint": A concise version of the title (max 3 words).

**Token Optimization:** Keep "description" fields concise (1-2 sentences) to allow space for MORE TOPICS.

Output Format:
Respond with a single JSON object containing two arrays:
- "monetizationSection": Array of Core Topics.
