- Price/cost modifiers (e.g., "Cheap [Service]" → SPOKE)
- Urgency variants (e.g., "Emergency [Service]" → SPOKE)
- Size/scope variants (e.g., "Small Business [Service]" → SPOKE)
- Brand comparisons (e.g., "[Service] vs [Competitor]" → SPOKE)

**VALID CORE TOPIC EXAMPLES:**
- Different service categories (Installation vs Repair vs Maintenance)
- Different product types (Residential vs Commercial systems)
- Different problem domains (Detection vs Prevention vs Response)
- Different functional areas (Assessment vs Implementation vs Support)

    *   **HARD CONSTRAINT (1:7 HUB-SPOKE RATIO):** For EVERY Core Topic, generate exactly **7 unique Spokes**.
    *   *Spoke Ideas:* Location variants, price tiers, urgency levels, specific use cases, comparisons, checklists.
    *   *Example Structure:* "[Service Type]" (Core) → "Emergency [Service Type]", "[Service Type] Costs", "[Service Type] in [Location]", etc. (Spokes)

2.  **Informational Section (Author Section / Trust Pages):**
    *   Topics related to "${pillars.centralEntity} + Knowledge/Background/Trust".

### **STRICT EXECUTION RULES**

#### **I. FOUNDATIONAL STRATEGY & ENTITY ALIGNMENT**
1.  **Central Entity Focus (Rule I.A):** Every heading and sub-heading must modify the Central Entity ("${pillars.centralEntity}"). Reject broad generalizations.
2.  **Source Context Alignment (Rule I.B):** Filter attributes based on the Source Context ("${pillars.sourceContext}"). Only include attributes relevant to the monetization intent (e.g., if context is "Enterprise", exclude "Free" or "Cheap").
3.  **Attribute Prioritization (Rule I.D):** Structure the 'outline' to prioritize **Unique Attributes** (definitive features/IDs) FIRST, followed by **Root Attributes** (Definitions/Nature), then **Rare Attributes** (Specific details).

#### **II. STRUCTURE & FLOW**
1.  **Contextual Vector (Rule II.B):** Ensure a strictly ordered heading hierarchy (H1 -> H2 -> H3) that creates a logical dependency chain.
2.  **The Contextual Bridge (Rule II.D):** You MUST define a specific 'contextualBridge' object. This is a dedicated section (transition paragraph) that bridges the **Macro Context** (The Site's Core Entity) to the **Micro Context** (This Article's Topic).
3.  **Subordinate Text (Rule II.F):** For every H2/H3 in the 'structured_outline', provide a 'subordinate_text_hint'. This MUST dictate the syntax of the *very first sentence* (e.g., "Define [Topic] as [Category] that [Function]...").
4.  **Introductory Summary (Rule II.E):** Mandate an abstractive summary at the start.

#### **III. LINGUISTIC DIRECTIVES**
1.  **Explicit Naming (Rule III.D):** Instruct the writer to use **Explicit Naming**. Strictly FORBID ambiguous pronouns ("it", "they", "this") when referring to the Central Entity.
2.  **No Opinion (Rule III.G):** Strictly FORBID subjective phrases ("I think", "In my opinion", "Ideally"). Require declarative facts.
3.  **Discourse Integration (Rule III.H):** Generate a list of 'discourse_anchors'. These are specific mutual words/phrases to use at the end of Paragraph A and the start of Paragraph B to ensure flow.
4.  **Featured Snippet Target (Rule III.C):** Identify the SINGLE most important question this article answers. Define it as the 'featured_snippet_target'. The answer target length must be < 40 words.

#### **IV. VISUAL SEMANTICS**
1.  **Data over Photos (Rule IV.A):** Do not request generic stock photos. Populate 'visual_semantics' with specific descriptions of **Infographics**, **Charts**, or **Data Tables** that represent the EAVs.

#### **V. INTERLINKING**
1.  **Post-Definition Linking (Rule V.C):** In the 'contextualBridge' instructions, specify that links must be placed *after* the entity has been defined, never in the first sentence of a paragraph.

### **STRICT ALGORITHMIC AUTHORSHIP RULES**

#### **I. FOUNDATIONAL & STRATEGIC (IDENTITY & AUTHORITY)**
1.  **Entity Focus:** Maintain strict focus on the Central Entity. Avoid tangental topics that dilute relevance.
2.  **Expert Persona:** Write from the perspective of the defined Author Profile. Leverage specific credentials or experience where appropriate to demonstrate E-E-A-T.

#### **II. LINGUISTIC DENSITY & SYNTAX**
1.  **One Fact Per Sentence:** Maximize Information Density. Adhere to a strict 'One Fact Per Sentence' rule where possible.
2.  **Short Dependency Trees:** Construct sentences with a short Dependency Tree. One Subject-Predicate-Object per sentence. Avoid overly complex compound clauses that obscure the entity relationship.
3.  **Explicit Naming (No Pronouns):** Minimize the use of ambiguous pronouns (it, they, this, that) when referring to the Central Entity. Explicitly repeat the Noun to ensure **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** tracking.

#### **III. STRUCTURE & FORMAT RULES**
1.  **Question Protection (Rule III.C):** If a heading is a question (e.g., "What is X?"), the **IMMEDIATELY** following sentence must be the direct, definitive answer. Do not start with "When looking at..." or "It is important to note...".
    *   *Bad:* "H2: What is SEO? -> There are many factors to consider..."
    *   *Good:* "H2: What is SEO? -> SEO is the process of optimizing..."
2.  **List Logic (Rule III.D):** Before any list (bulleted or numbered), provide a definitive introductory sentence stating the count or nature of the list (e.g., "The 5 key factors are:", "The following components include:").
3.  **Subordinate Text:** The first sentence of *every* section must be a high-value candidate passage.

#### **IV. SPECIFIC BRIEF REQUIREMENTS**
${brief.featured_snippet_target ? `
- **FEATURED SNIPPET TARGET:**
  - **Target Question:** "${brief.featured_snippet_target.question}"
  - **Instruction:** The section addressing this question MUST answer it **immediately** in the first sentence.
  - **Constraint:** The answer passage must be **under ${brief.featured_snippet_target.answer_target_length} words** (approx 300-350 characters).
  - **Format:** ${brief.featured_snippet_target.target_type}
  - **Required Predicates:** Use definitive verbs like "${brief.featured_snippet_target.required_predicates.join(', ')}".
` : '- Identify the core definition and answer it concisely in the first sentence (<40 words).'}

#### **V. DISCOURSE INTEGRATION (FLOW)**
- **Rule:** Use the provided \`discourse_anchors\` to transition smoothly between paragraphs.
- **Logic:** The end of Paragraph A should semantically "hook" into the start of Paragraph B using mutual keywords or concepts.
- **Anchors:** ${brief.discourse_anchors ? brief.discourse_anchors.join(', ') : 'Ensure logical semantic transitions.'}

#### **VI. VISUAL SEMANTICS**
- **Rule:** Do not describe generic images. Insert specific placeholders for the defined data visualizations.

### **POLISHING INSTRUCTIONS**

1.  **Rewrite Introduction:** Now that the content body is complete, rewrite the introduction to be a perfect abstractive summary of what follows. It must align perfectly with the final content.
2.  **Convert to HTML Structures:**
    *   Identify dense paragraphs that list items. Convert them to **Markdown Lists** (bullets or numbered).
    *   Identify comparative sections. Convert them to **Markdown Tables**.
    *   Ensure lists are preceded by a definitive sentence ending in a colon.
3.  **Insert Visual Placeholders:**
    *   Review the text for complex concepts.
    *   Insert \`[IMAGE: description]\` markers where a visual would aid comprehension.
    *   Ensure \`visual_semantics\` from the brief are represented if not already present.
4.  **Review First Sentences:**
    *   Scan the first sentence of every H2/H3 section.
    *   Ensure it is a definitive statement ("X is Y").
    *   Remove "fluff" transitions ("Turning to the next point...").
5.  **Formatting:**
    *   Ensure clean Markdown headers (H1, H2, H3).
    *   **Bold** key entities and definitions for scannability.

**Output:**
Return the fully polished, publication-ready article draft in Markdown. Do not wrap in JSON. Return raw Markdown.

   - More than 15 spokes = DILUTED (WARNING)
   - Flag each hub with its actual spoke count

2. **Section Classification (Rule E - CRITICAL):**
   - All topics MUST have topic_class: "monetization" or "informational"
   - Monetization (Core Section): Services, products, pricing, quotes
   - Informational (Author Section): Educational, guides, explanations
   - Flag topics with missing or "unknown" classification

3. **Type Misclassification (Rule G - CRITICAL):**
   - Core topics MUST represent DISTINCT attribute facets, NOT variations/modifiers
   - **MISCLASSIFIED AS CORE (Should be OUTER):**
     * Location variants ("[Service] in [City]" → Should be outer)
     * Price modifiers ("Cheap/Affordable [Service]" → Should be outer)
     * Urgency variants ("Emergency [Service]" → Should be outer)
     * Size variants ("Small Business [Service]" → Should be outer)
     * Comparisons ("[Service] vs [Competitor]" → Should be outer)
   - **VALID CORE TOPICS:**
     * Different service categories (Installation vs Repair vs Maintenance)
     * Different product types (Residential vs Commercial systems)
     * Different problem domains (Detection vs Prevention vs Response)
   - Flag any core topic that appears to be a modifier/variant of another core topic
   - Suggest reclassification: which core topic it should become a spoke of

4. **Orphan Detection (Rule F - WARNING):**
   - All outer topics MUST have a valid parent_topic_id
   - Flag orphaned topics that need parent assignment

5. **Focus Check (Rule A - CRITICAL):**
   - Topics must align with Central Entity ("${pillars.centralEntity}")
   - Flag topics about related but distinct entities

6. **Context Check (Rule B - WARNING):**
   - Topics must align with Source Context ("${pillars.sourceContext}")
   - Flag contradicting topics (e.g., "Free" topics when context is "Enterprise")

7. **Flow Check (Rule C - WARNING):**
   - Author Section clusters must semantically bridge to Core Section

**CRITICAL HIERARCHY RULES (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Hub-Spoke Ratio (1:7)**: Every Core Topic (hub) MUST have approximately 7 Outer Topics (spokes).
2. **Section Classification**: New topics MUST be assigned to either "monetization" (Core Section) or "informational" (Author Section).
3. **Parent Assignment**: Every new Outer Topic MUST specify which Core Topic it belongs to.
4. **Link Flow Direction**: Author Section topics support Core Section topics with PageRank flow.

${JSON.stringify(issues, null, 2)}

**Instructions:**
Generate concrete actions to resolve ALL issues while maintaining proper hierarchy.

1. **For UNDER_SUPPORTED hubs** (spokeCount < 7): Add new outer topics as spokes. Each new spoke MUST specify:
   - "parentTopicTitle": The exact title of the core topic it belongs to
   - "topic_class": "monetization" or "informational"

2. **For new CORE topics**: They become new hubs and should have at least 3-5 initial spokes suggested.

3. **For topics to DELETE**: Consider if their semantic content should be MERGED into another topic instead of pure deletion.

4. **For MISCLASSIFIED topics** (core topics that should be outer):
   - Reclassify location variants, price modifiers, urgency variants as OUTER topics
   - Assign them to the appropriate core topic parent
   - Keep valid distinct attribute facets as CORE topics

1.  **contextual_vector**: A logical sequence of 3-5 H2 headings that define the content flow (e.g., "H2: Definition > H2: Benefits > H2: Process").
2.  **methodology**: The specific article format (e.g., "Comparative Analysis with Table", "Step-by-Step Guide", "Definitive List").
3.  **subordinate_hint**: Specific instructions for the *first sentence* of the article (e.g., "Define X as Y using a definitive verb").
4.  **perspective**: The specific persona/angle required (e.g., "Technical Analyst", "Consumer Advocate").
5.  **interlinking_strategy**: A rule for how this page should link to other pages (e.g., "Link to Core Section for definition of [Entity]").
6.  **anchor_text**: The recommended anchor text to use when OTHER pages link TO this topic.
7.  **annotation_hint**: A hint for the text surrounding the anchor link (e.g., "Mention this when discussing cost efficiencies").

${jsonResponseInstruction}

**Audit Rules:**
1.  **Vector Straightness (Rule I.A):** Extract the H1, H2, and H3 headings. Check if they form a logical, incremental progression (e.g. Definition -> Features -> Benefits). Flag any heading that deviates from the main topic or backtracks contextually.
2.  **Attribute Order (Rule I.B):** The content should ideally present **Unique Attributes** (Specific identifiers) before **Root Attributes** (Definitions) and **Rare Attributes** (Deep details). Flag sections where deep/rare details appear before the core definition is established.

**Audit Logic:**
For every sequential pair of paragraphs (Para A -> Para B):
1. Check the *last sentence* of Para A.
2. Check the *first sentence* of Para B.
3. Do they share a mutual term, concept, or explicit transition?
4. If the subject changes abruptly without a bridge, it is a "Discourse Gap".
