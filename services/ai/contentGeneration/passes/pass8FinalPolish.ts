/**
 * Pass 8: Final Polish (Section-by-Section)
 *
 * This pass performs publication-ready polishing of each section individually,
 * ensuring structural elements (lists, tables, images) from earlier passes
 * are preserved.
 *
 * CRITICAL CHANGE: Previously processed entire article at once, which allowed
 * AI to remove lists/tables/images added in earlier passes. Now uses
 * section-by-section processing like passes 2-7.
 *
 * Key responsibilities:
 * 1. Smooth transitions between paragraphs
 * 2. Consistent tone and voice throughout
 * 3. Remove redundancy and filler words
 * 4. Strengthen weak sentences
 * 5. Ensure publication readiness
 *
 * PRESERVATION: Lists, tables, images, headings MUST be preserved.
 * The prompt explicitly counts these elements and requires exact preservation.
